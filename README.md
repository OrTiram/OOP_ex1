In this task I developed a data structure and algorithms.
The task is to develop a data structure of an unintended weighted graph.
After implementing the data structure I applied algorithms such as calculating the shortest path, if the graph is connected and more.

Initially I did a WGraph_DS class that implements an interface graph and represents an unintentionally weighted graph, with an internal class that builds the vertices of the graph.
In the WGraph_DS class I performed functions such as: remove node, remove edge, connect - which connects between two nodes, edgeSize - returns the number of edges and other functions.

Next, I did a WGraph_Algo class that implements algorithmic graphs and represents a collection of algorithms on unintended weighted graphs.
In the WGraph_Algo class I performed functions such as: shortestPath which returns the shortest path in the graph between src and dest.
In addition, a copy function that copies the current graph to the new graph.
 Another function is shortestPathDist which returns the shortest path length between src and dest.

In this task I performed tests for the departments to check that the functions were working and indeed it helped to understand the process of building the functions significantly and in depth.
